I'm with the band
Some days you're the dog, some days you're the hydrant
Good. Fast. Cheap. Choose two
Follow you dreams. (Execpt the one where your at school in your underwear.)
Okay, who stopped the payment on my reality check?
My mind is made up. Please don't confuse me with the facts
I'm so broke I can't even pay attention
Nothing's impossible for those who don't have to do it
Tell Me, where is this bright side you speak of?
A conclusion is the place where you get tired of thinking
What is there where no hypothetical questions?
We are born naked, wet, and hungry. Then things get worse.
I'm looking forward to regretting this
I used to think I was indecisive, but mow I'm not so sure
Grow your own dope, plant a man
You deserve what you accept
Why can't I be rich and good looking?
I'm not a Complete Idiot. Some parts are missing
Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups
I've seen normal. It ain't pretty
It's easier to get forgiveness than permission
Don't judge a book by its movie
Don't you think hard work must've killed someone?
They told me I was gullible, and I belived them
If you aren't completely appalled, then you haven't been paying attention
Be nice to your kids. They'll choose your nursing home.
I'm going off to find myself. If you see me before I get back, please let me know where I'll be
